# ResumeSimilarityScanner

This is a very simple notebook for comparing two documents

It uses CountVectorizer and cosine similarity to determine the percentage similarity of the documents

In the future, I'd like to expand across more than two documents (ex: multiple resumes to one job description or vice versa), and also expand to more supported document types like PDF

Taking things one step further would be to add automation for scraping/collecting documents
